PkgAudit
    A tool for auditing packages on Debian(Ubuntu) based linux systems. At the 
    moment the tool outputs a CSV with the following information about packages
    installed on the system: 
    * Package Name
    * Package Version
    * Package Repositories
    * Package Licenses
    
Built using the dpkg-licenses tool from daald on github: 
    https://github.com/daald/dpkg-licenses
    
    Go give him props for making a SUPER useful tool that I could build on.
